**Variables**
 
 The variables in the output tidy data set contains
 
 - activity id
 - subject id
 - average of features related to mean measurement
 - average of features related to standard deviation measurement
 
 **Data**
 
 The original data is the combination of both training data set and test data set,
 and only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
 
 **Data Processing**
 
To acquire the tidy data set, it takes several processing steps as following

- read signal data together with activity list and subject list for both training set and test set
- merge training set and test set
- extract only the features related to mean value and standard deviation
- label all the variables properly
- create another tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
